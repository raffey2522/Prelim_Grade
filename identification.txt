=============Answers=================

A.)For me from its word; SINLGE, Single-threaded means doing a certain task at a certain point of time. For example is how CPU processes, it is by giving every single task a so called "CPU TIME" so that all the tasks or programms will be accomodated accordingly to its commands or functions.

B.)An Event driven Architecture is like a function that pushes about the behavior status of an event or any process that is significant to the hardware or software system.

C.)For me one of the benefits of JS Module is that it promotes self-contained codes.
